        <h1>About Me</h1>
        

<div class="container text-center">
        I am good at providing technical training to staff on all matters related to the operational
                activities on a day to day bases. My career has allowed me to develop new job-aids for staff,
                including
                documentation and videos covering website navigation while building an online module using Adobe
                Captivate.
                However, over the last eight years or more, I developed a strong passion for web development,
                program development,
                and earned a Masters in Instructional Science and Technology. I later then realized how much I love
                being on computers and then it dawns on me. Iâ€™ve been a web developer my entire life.</p>
    
                <p>As a web developer, I enjoy the creative outlet it provides by being able to think about
                    something
                    and make it come to life. I find programming fun and fantasticating. My goal is to create
                    different
                    user-friendly applications where people can access all types of content they can produce.</p>
    
                Attention to details which comes in quite handy when it comes to front-end and back-end development.
                I enjoy learning new things whether it is HTML, CSS or just more of JavaScript.    <a href="Johanna Casimir-Mahoney Resume.pdf" class="example_b">Download Resume</a>
